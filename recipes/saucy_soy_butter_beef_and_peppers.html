    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Heaps of crunchy, crisp-tender shishitos bring their welcoming, vegetal freshness to deeply browned beef and a pool of savory sauce slicked with a bit of butter. Use a mix of mild peppers—Cubanelle, banana, Anaheim—instead of, or alongside, the shishitos (just seed and trim into approximately 1" strips). Stick with low-sodium soy sauce and premium (rather than regular) oyster sauce if possible to ensure your finished dish isn’t overwhelmingly salty. As with any stir-fry, prep is key—about 15 minutes of slicing and marinating will successfully set you up for the final, dizzyingly fast cook.

        <li>2 Tbsp. cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp. low-sodium soy sauce</li>

        <li>⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup premium oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tsp. cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>6 scallions, white and pale green parts and dark green parts separated, sliced on a diagonal into 1" pieces</li>
        <li>12 oz. shishito peppers, stems removed, sliced in half on a diagonal</li>
        <li>6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 1" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Steamed rice (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Toss 1 lb. boneless New York strip steak or sirloin, thinly sliced, 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, 2 tsp. low-sodium soy sauce, and 2 tsp. vegetable oil in a medium bowl with your hands until meat is evenly coated. Let sit at least 15 minutes and up to 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill if resting longer than 45 minutes. No need to bring to room temperature before cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk ⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce, ¼ cup premium oyster sauce, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 1 Tbsp. distilled white vinegar, 2 tsp. cornstarch, 2 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper, and ⅔ cup water in a small bowl to combine; set sauce aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in large heavy pot over medium-high. Add half of beef in a single layer, separating clumps as much as possible (it's okay if it's a bit crowded). Cook, undisturbed, until deep golden brown underneath (meat will be pale on other side), about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Repeat process with another 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and remaining beef.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in same pot over medium-high. Cook 6 scallions, white and pale green parts sliced on a diagonal into 1" pieces, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred in spots, about 2 minutes. Add 12 oz. shishito peppers, stems removed, sliced in half on a diagonal, 6 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced, and one 1" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped, and cook, stirring often, until garlic is fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add beef and reserved sauce (stir well first to dissolve settled cornstarch) and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Remove pot from heat and add dark green scallion parts, sliced on a diagonal into 1" pieces, and 2 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces. Stir vigorously until butter is melted. Season with more kosher salt if needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve stir-fry in a large shallow bowl or on a platter with steamed rice.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
