    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When the mercury drops, we make baked pasta dishes on repeat for cozy Sunday suppers. If you're new to cooking these large-format classics, learning how to make baked ziti is a good place to start. It's simpler and more forgiving than lasagna but still delivers comforting bites full of pulls of mozzarella and those much coveted crunchy corners. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This baked ziti recipe is designed to stay saucy. While many call for ricotta, it has a tendency to get dry and grainy when baked, so we've swapped it for a creamy Parmesan béchamel. And in place of meatballs, ground turkey, or Italian sausage, we prefer a bit of pancetta, which adds a salty and porky hit to homemade tomato sauce without distracting from the overall composition.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <span><em>6 Servings</em></span>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2¼ cups whole milk, slightly warmed</li>
        <li>2½ cups grated Parmesan, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ounce pancetta (Italian bacon), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 28-ounce can plus 1 14-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 pound ziti, penne, or rigatoni</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <p></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foamy. Sprinkle flour over and cook, whisking constantly, 1 minute. Gradually whisk in warm milk. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, whisking often, until béchamel is thickened to about the consistency of heavy cream and no longer feels grainy when rubbed between your fingers, 8-10 minutes (thoroughly cooking the mixture ensures a creamy sauce and eliminates any raw flour flavor). Remove from heat and add 2 cups Parmesan, whisking until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Cook pancetta, stirring often, until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until onion is golden and soft, 8-10 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until slightly darkened, about 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add whole peeled tomatoes, crushing with your hands as you go, and season with salt and pepper. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until slightly reduced and flavors have melded, 20-25 minutes. Let cool slightly, then transfer to a blender; pulse until mostly smooth (or use an immersion blender and purée directly in pot). Stir in basil and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 5 minutes (the pasta will continue to cook in the oven); drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer reserved béchamel to a large bowl; add pasta and mozzarella and toss to combine. Add all but 1 cup tomato sauce and gently fold mixture a few times, leaving streaks of béchamel.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Transfer pasta mixture to a 13x9-inch or other 3-quart baking dish, dollop with remaining tomato sauce, and scatter remaining Parmesan over pasta. Bake until mozzarella is melted and sauce is bubbling around the edges, 15-20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat broiler. Broil until pasta and cheese are dark brown in spots, about 4 minutes. Let pasta sit 5 minutes before serving. </p>
